# NowForecast

In this project, I created a Javascript waether app, where a user is able to search in the input field and can see a 5-day forecast of their local city or any other city they desire depending on the search.

## User-Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
